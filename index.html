            Hello! My name is Hannah Yudkin. I graduated the University of New Hampshire in 2018 with a degree in Marking and a degree in Computer Information Systems. I really like programming and plan on one day getting a Masters degree in Computer Science.

            One of my favorite things to do is bake. My specialties are cupcakes and I really like to making pretty designs and try new flavors. I spend a lot of my free time playing videogames, mostly cool indie games, or being active. I like to bike and have done a Tough Mudder in the past.

                After I finish this course I'm planning on getting a job right afterwards. I'm a very motivated, driven person and have high aspirations. I'm hoping to learn the skills necessary to be sucessful in this field.
